# What happens when you change Visual Studio subscription levels?

In Visual Studio subscriptions, the software, tools, services, and other benefits that you receive depend on your subscription level. Higher subscription levels include more robust benefits.

You might need to change levels for several reasons. For example, you might want a more full‑featured version of the Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE). Your company's subscription admin might also adjust your subscription based on your role, your current project, or purchasing needs.

Depending on your new subscription level, you might need to take action to keep access to your benefits. How your benefits change when you change the subscription level depends on the benefit type. This article provides examples and explains the effects of upgrades and downgrades for key benefits.

## Do you need to take action?

| Scenario | Do you need to act? | What to check |
| -------- | ------------------- | ------------- |
| Upgrade | Usually | Install the higher IDE version, and then review new benefits. |
| Downgrade | Yes | Verify IDE licensing for the higher edition and review benefits that might no longer apply. |
| Same level, new subscription ID | Yes | Reactivate Azure credits and move Azure assets if you used the prior Azure subscription. |

## What happens to Visual Studio IDE access?

For information about which version of Visual Studio is included in your subscription, see the [Visual Studio Subscriptions and Benefits](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/benefits/) page. To learn about the differences between the editions included in your subscription, see the [Compare Visual Studio Editions](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/compare/) page.

### If you upgrade

You get access to the IDE edition included in your new subscription. To use it, uninstall the lower version and install the higher version.

### If you downgrade

You keep perpetual use rights for the version included at the higher level. You might not be able to sign in to keep using that higher edition after your access changes.

To avoid disruption, confirm that you can still validate the IDE license before your subscription level changes. You can perform this validation by signing in with an eligible account or by using a product key from the [Product Keys](https://my.visualstudio.com/productkeys) page of the subscription portal. [Learn more about finding and claiming product keys](find-keys.md).

## What happens to individual Azure credits?

Your Azure credit amount depends on your subscription level. Depending on your level, you might receive between $0 and $150 per month.

When your subscription changes (upgrade, downgrade, or new subscription ID), the behavior is the same. The link between your Visual Studio subscription and your Azure subscription breaks. Activating the benefit in your new subscription creates a new Azure subscription, and the old one becomes subject to deactivation.

To avoid losing your Azure assets, choose one of these options:

+ Convert the old subscription to [pay‑as‑you‑go](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0023p/) billing. A payment method is required.  
+ Create a new Azure subscription by using your new benefits and move your existing assets into the new subscription.

## What happens to software downloads?

Your available software downloads depend on your subscription level. For details, see the [list of available software downloads](software-download-list.md).

> [!TIP]
> The software titles that you see on the [Your Downloads and Product Keys](https://my.visualstudio.com/downloads) page depends on the highest subscription level assigned to your sign-in email address. If you have Visual Studio Enterprise and Visual Studio Dev Essentials, you see Visual Studio Enterprise titles regardless of which membership you're signed in with.

## What happens to other benefits?

Other benefits behave differently, depending on type.

### Benefits that have a fixed length

If you activated a time-based benefit before your subscription changed, you usually keep it for the remainder of its original term. For example, a six-month training benefit activated under Enterprise continues even if you moved to Professional.

### Benefits that require authentication

Some benefits require authentication each time you sign in. Authenticated benefits aren't available after a downgrade if the new level doesn't include them.

### Benefits that aren't available in lower subscription levels

If you're using benefits offered in your current subscription but not in the subscription to which yours is downgraded, you might lose access to those benefits.
