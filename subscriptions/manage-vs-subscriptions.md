# Manage Visual Studio subscriptions

The Visual Studio [subscription portal](https://my.visualstudio.com) gives you the ability to manage all your subscriptions and program memberships in a single place. You can use it to make changes to your profile, use the benefits included with your subscriptions, and switch between subscriptions.

> [!NOTE]
> The Visual Studio [subscription portal](https://my.visualstudio.com?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs) and [admin portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com) don't support [GCC High tenants](https://learn.microsoft.com/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/office-365-us-government/gcc-high-and-dod), also known as private or government domains. This limitation also applies to subscribers who try to sign in to the Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE). To access Visual Studio subscriptions, your organization needs to have a public tenant. For assistance in creating a public tenant, contact [Azure support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/create-ticket/).

## Manage multiple subscriptions

The Visual Studio subscription portal brings together all your Visual Studio subscriptions and programs in a single portal experience. For example, you might have one subscription through work, and another subscription or Visual Studio Dev Essentials membership that you use at home.

On the **Benefits** page, the subscription in use appears in the dropdown list next to **Featured benefit**. You can use the list to switch between subscriptions if you have more than one. If you have only one subscription, the list is unavailable.

Another way to switch between subscriptions is to select the **Subscriptions** tab and then select the desired subscription.

If your subscription isn't visible:

+ The subscription might be expired. Only active subscriptions appear in the subscription portal.
+ The subscription might be associated with a different email address. If you have multiple subscriptions and they're assigned to different email addresses, you only see one at a time. To switch to a different subscription, sign out of the portal and sign in with the email that's associated with the desired subscription.
+ If your company buys subscriptions through a volume license, it's possible that your admin didn't assign one to you or reassigned your subscription to another user.

## Renew subscriptions

### Standard subscriptions

If you purchased your subscription from the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store), you can renew it there.

If your company buys subscriptions through a volume license, your admin should contact a reseller to renew your subscription.

### Cloud subscriptions

Cloud subscriptions don't need to be renewed. As long as your subscription is paid, it remains active.

### Subscriptions acquired through programs

If you get a subscription through a program, the subscription is tied to your participation in the program. For information about renewals, reach out to your program contacts. Common programs include:

+ [Azure Dev Tools for Teaching](https://azureforeducation.microsoft.com/Institutions)
+ [Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program](https://partner.microsoft.com)
+ [Microsoft Certified Trainer](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/mct-certification.aspx)

## Transfer subscriptions

If your subscription was purchased through Microsoft volume licensing and you need to reassign it to someone else within the organization, your admin can help you.

An admin can transfer retail subscriptions to another user by contacting customer service. Complimentary or Not For Resale subscriptions can't be transferred.

## Manage your profile

For easier subscription management, you can create and manage a profile in the subscription portal. You can also:

+ Make changes to your identity information.
+ Associate your subscriptions with other sign-in identities from existing Azure accounts or Azure DevOps organizations by using alternate identities.

### Change profile information

To change the contact information and preferences in your profile:

1. In the upper-right corner of the subscription portal, select your name.

2. Select the **Edit profile** button.

3. On the **About** tab, you can change your name, email, country/region, profile picture, and contact preferences.

   On the **Preferences** tab, you can select your preferred language, date and time patterns, time zone, and user interface theme.

4. When you finish making changes, select **Save**.

5. Select your browser's **Back** button to return to the **Benefits** page.

### Set communication preferences

To receive periodic updates and newsletters about your subscription and benefits, go to the [Edit Profile](https://app.vsaex.visualstudio.com/me?workflowID=devprogram&tab=edit) page in the subscription portal and select the **Visual Studio Subscriptions** checkbox. You can change your preferences and unsubscribe at any time.

### Link a subscription to an existing Azure DevOps or Azure subscription

If you sign in to your subscription by using a personal Microsoft account and you have an Azure DevOps Services or Microsoft Azure subscription that uses an Azure-managed work or school account, you can link the two subscriptions. Use an *alternate account* to keep using your Microsoft account to sign in to your subscription and still have access to existing Azure, Azure DevOps Services, or IDE resources associated with your work or school account.

Even if both accounts use the same email address, you need to add your work or school account as an alternate to use your benefits across both accounts.

To add an alternate account:

1. Sign in to the [subscription portal](https://my.visualstudio.com?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs) by using your Microsoft account.

2. Select the **Subscriptions** tab.

3. Under **Alternate account**, select **Add alternate account**.

4. Enter the email address for your work or school account, and then select **Add**.

After you add an alternate account, you can update or remove it at any time:

1. Select the **Subscriptions** tab.

2. In the **Related Links** section, select the appropriate option.
