# What happens when your Visual Studio subscription expires?

Visual Studio subscriptions have specific durations and expire unless you renew them. When a subscription expires, the benefits that the subscription provides are affected in various ways. This article explains how expiration affects aspects of a Visual Studio subscription.

## Downloads

The [Downloads](https://my.visualstudio.com/downloads) page of the subscription portal is still available for downloading software, but new product keys can no longer be claimed. Updates, patches, and other tools might still be available in the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/downloads). Products that you previously downloaded via your subscription are still valid.

## Product keys

The [Product Keys](https://my.visualstudio.com/productkeys) page of the subscription portal is no longer available. Any previously claimed keys still function as they normally would. All installation limits remain unaffected.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To ensure that your product keys are available after your subscription expires, you need to export them before the expiration date of your subscription. To export your keys, go to the **Product Keys** page and select the **Export all keys** button.

## Benefits

You can't activate any benefits after your subscription expires. Previously activated benefits might still be available, depending on how they're authenticated.

Most Microsoft partner benefits, such as Pluralsight training, are still available for the duration of the benefit. Benefits that require validation that a Visual Studio subscription is still current aren't available.

### Visual Studio IDE

Most subscriptions provide perpetual licenses for the Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE).

To determine if your subscription is eligible for perpetual use rights, check the [Visual Studio licensing guidance](https://aka.ms/vslicensing). If your subscription is eligible, you continue to have access to your *current version* of the IDE but won't receive updates to future versions.

To continue using the IDE after expiration, go to the [Product Keys](https://my.visualstudio.com/productkeys) page and download the product key *before your subscription expires*. After you claim the key, [enter it](/visualstudio/ide/how-to-unlock-visual-studio#enter-a-product-key) to activate your IDE installation.

### Azure DevOps

Azure DevOps acquired through a Visual Studio subscription is unavailable.

### Azure credits

Monthly Azure credit allotments continue for a limited time after expiration of your subscription. Unused credits already applied to your Azure subscription in the current month are still available for your use.

If you want to continue using Azure resources from that subscription after your credits are exhausted, you can either [transfer those resources](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/move-resource-group-and-subscription) to another Azure subscription or [convert your existing subscription to pay-as-you-go billing](/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/spending-limit#remove-the-spending-limit-in-azure-portal).

### Other benefits

Many of the benefits included in Visual Studio subscriptions have specific durations. Benefits that Microsoft partners like Pluralsight or Cloud Academy provide have time limits after you activate them.

Benefits that you activated previously are available to you for the remainder of the term. For example, if you activated a six-month Pluralsight subscription and it still has four months remaining when your Visual Studio subscription expires, you can access it for those four months.

## Resources

For assistance with sales, accounts, and billing for your Visual Studio subscriptions, go to the [Get Help](https://aka.ms/vssubscriberhelp) page of the subscription portal.
