# Visual Studio subscription portal

The [Visual Studio subscription portal](https://my.visualstudio.com?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs) is your all-in-one resource to take advantage of the benefits that your Visual Studio subscription provides.

Sign in to the portal by using the identity that's associated with your subscription. This identity might be your Microsoft account or an email address that an organization (such as your employer or school) provided to you. You can also sign in by using your GitHub credentials.

> [!NOTE]
> The Visual Studio [subscription portal](https://my.visualstudio.com?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs) and [admin portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com) don't support [GCC High tenants](https://learn.microsoft.com/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/office-365-us-government/gcc-high-and-dod), also known as private or government domains. This limitation also applies to subscribers who try to sign in to the Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE). To access Visual Studio subscriptions, your organization needs to have a public tenant. For assistance in creating a public tenant, contact [Azure support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/create-ticket/).

You can:

+ [Sign in by using your Microsoft account](sign-in-msa.md)
+ [Sign in by using your work or school account](sign-in-work.md)
+ [Sign in by using GitHub](sign-in-github.md)

The portal has six pages: **Benefits**, **Downloads**, **Product Keys**, **Subscriptions**, **Get Help**, and **Marketplace**. Each page provides you with access to products or services included with your subscription.

## Benefits

The tools, services, and partner offers included with your subscription are displayed as tiles on the [Benefits](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs) page. Not all benefits are included with all subscriptions. The tiles are grouped into three categories:

+ **Tools**: This category is where you find the core development tools, such as the Visual Studio IDE, Azure DevOps, and partner tools. It also contains other Azure services and Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise E5.

+ **Professional Development**: This category contains benefits such as online training from Microsoft and partners, along with a subscription to CODE Magazine. These benefits help you advance your development skills and stay abreast of all things code.

+ **Support**: Do you have a question about Azure? Get help from the Azure community via forums or take advantage of Azure Advisory Chat (preview). The Concierge Chat service is available to help you find technical documentation and product information, and to assist with subscription-related questions. Some subscriptions also include incident-based technical support to help you resolve issues with a wide range of Microsoft products running in dev/test environments.

## Downloads

Depending on your subscription or program, you might have access to various software downloads on the [Downloads](https://my.visualstudio.com/downloads?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs) page. These downloads can range from updates and patches to an extensive library of current products and older versions so that you can test your apps in a wide variety of scenarios.

To make it easy for users who have multiple subscriptions assigned to the same email address, this page shows the downloads available to your highest subscription. That way, you can see all your downloads no matter which subscription you're currently using.

## Product Keys

On the [Product Keys](https://my.visualstudio.com/productkeys?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs) page, you can get keys to install and activate products, and you can see what keys you already claimed. You can even export a list of all your keys for safekeeping.

## Subscriptions

The [Subscriptions](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs) page shows which subscriptions you own. You can switch between subscriptions, renew them, and activate new subscriptions. You can also associate subscriptions that you access by using your Microsoft account with an [alternate account](vs-alternate-identity.md). An alternate account is associated with an existing Visual Studio IDE, Azure DevOps, or Azure resources.

## Get Help

In addition to the individual benefits found in the **Support** category on the **Benefits** page, the **Get Help** page provides access to resources for maximizing your Visual Studio subscription. Access [support resources](https://aka.ms/vssubscriberhelp) to resolve technical issues or questions related to subscriptions sales, accounts, and billing.

## Marketplace

Do you need to purchase a Visual Studio cloud subscription? Do you want to download the latest extensions for the Visual Studio family of products? [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/) helps you find extensions, tools, and services that make Azure DevOps, Azure DevOps Server, and Visual Studio Code even better. You can even become a publisher and release your own extensions on Visual Studio Marketplace.
